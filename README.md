# R_Programming_Playground
This is a repository to store my experiments in ‘R’ programming as I learn and play with the language. 

# visualization_ggplot_penguins01
visualization_ggplot_penguins01 makes use of ggplot to draw a trend line for a collection of points.

# visualization_ggplot_penguins02
visualization_ggplot_penguins02 makes use of ggplot to draw a three trend lines for each collection of points.

# dplyr
dplyr is a package for data wrangling that allows you to easily chain together operations speeding up your workflow and making your code much more readable.
%>% piping: Piping is much better when you start chaining lots of functions.

## Column operations
select(), mutate()

## Row operations
filter(), distinct(), arrange()

## Group Operations
group_by(), summarise(), count()

# Data_Tidying01
Variables, Observations, Values
pivot_longer(), pivot_wider()

# Resources
